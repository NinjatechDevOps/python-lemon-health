| Role assignment to users | ✅ Implemented | Many-to-many relationship between users and roles |
| Permission-based access control | ✅ Implemented | `has_permission` and `has_role` dependencies |

## 6. Modular, Extensible Architecture

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Organized services | ✅ Implemented | Separated into auth, accounts, core modules |
| Abstract base classes and factories | ✅ Implemented | `AuthProvider`, `OTPProvider` base classes |
| Reusable across projects | ✅ Implemented | Modular design with clear separation of concerns |

## 7. Test Utilities

| `/auth/providers` endpoint | ✅ Implemented | Lists available auth providers |
| `/auth/logout` endpoint | ❌ Not Implemented | Not yet implemented |
| `/auth/otp/resend` endpoint | ❌ Not Implemented | Not yet implemented |
| Admin routes | ❌ Not Implemented | Not yet implemented |

## 9. Email and SMS Template System

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Template-based messaging | ⚠️ Partial | Basic SMS messaging implemented but not templated |
| Templates for different purposes | ❌ Not Implemented | Not yet implemented |
| Localization support | ❌ Not Implemented | Not yet implemented |

## 10. Smart Defaults and Configuration Schema

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| `.env` and Pydantic settings | ✅ Implemented | `AuthConfig` and `Settings` classes |
| Sensible defaults | ✅ Implemented | Default values for token expiry, etc. |
| Config object overrides | ✅ Implemented | Config passed to `AuthModule` takes precedence |

## 11. Security Best Practices

## Summary

The authentication module has successfully implemented many of the core requirements, including:

- One-line integration with `AuthModule(app, config)`
- Factory pattern for authentication providers
- JWT-based token management
- OTP services with Twilio integration
- Role-based access control
- Modular, extensible architecture

Areas that need further development:

1. **Additional Authentication Methods**: Implement email and Google OAuth providers
2. **Admin APIs**: Add endpoints for role and user management
3. **Testing**: Add mock utilities and tests
4. **Templates**: Implement template system for messages
5. **Security Enhancements**: Add CSRF protection and rate limiting

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for authentication and authorization, with a modular design that allows for easy extension and customization.
